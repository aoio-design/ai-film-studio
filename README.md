# AI Film Studio

A private, login-protected **shot-review studio** for AI film production. It shows every shot of your film as a card — script text, audio, prompts, generated video, and your feedback notes — in one private web page you open in your browser.

Part of the **[Agentic AI Film Production Studio](https://store.aoiostudios.com/store)** guide. It runs on the same VPS as your AI agent; no extra hosting, no extra cost.

## Features

- **Shot cards** — one card per shot: script, audio files, image/video prompts (editable inline), generated video, and a feedback thread.
- **Video Preview** — a sequence player at the top of each episode page that plays every generated clip end-to-end, with Prev/Play/Next, Loop, and a Follow toggle that scrolls the card row in sync with playback.
- **Two formats per project** — `director` (Script → Audio → Video Prompt → Video) and `standard` (adds Image Prompt + Image rows). Switch by editing the `"format"` field in `data/projects.json`.
- **Email + password login** — real accounts (`owner` / `reviewer`), scrypt-hashed, stored in a local SQLite file. No email server needed, and none used.
- **Self-contained** — only needs Python + Flask. No database, no build step.
