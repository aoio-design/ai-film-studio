# AI Film Cinematography

## Overview

Cinematography decisions translated for AI generation. When directing image (GPT Image 2.5 Sunburst) and video (Seedance 2.5) prompts, you can't "set up a camera" — but you CAN encode every cinematography choice into the prompt. This skill maps filmmaking craft to AI-prompt language.

## When to Use

- The user needs shot-by-shot camera direction for a scene
- Writing first-frame prompts for video clips
- Determining lighting design for a scene
- Composing scenes within the image model's strengths (and avoiding its weaknesses)
- Any visual direction task in the pipeline

## Camera Shot Sizes

| Shot | What It Shows | Best For | Prompt Keyword |
|------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| **Extreme Wide Shot (EWS)** | Character is tiny in landscape | Establishing location | "extreme wide shot, tiny figure against vast landscape" |
| **Wide Shot (WS)** | Full body + environment | Action, entrance | "wide shot, full body visible" |
| **Medium Wide Shot (MWS)** | Knees up | Dialogue with context | "medium wide shot, cowboy shot" |
| **Medium Shot (MS)** | Waist up | Standard dialogue | "medium shot" |
| **Medium Closeup (MCU)** | Chest up | Emotional dialogue | "medium closeup, chest up" |
| **Closeup (CU)** | Face fills frame | Emotion, reaction | "closeup, face filling frame" |
| **Extreme Closeup (ECU)** | Eyes, hands, detail | Dramatic emphasis | "extreme closeup of eyes/hands" |

### AI-Reality: the image model is best at Medium to Medium Closeup
It produces the most photorealistic faces at **MCU to MS** range. Extreme closeups can look waxy. Wide shots often have garbled background details. Plan your "hero shots" (the frames you'll use as keyframes) in the MCU-MS range.

## Camera Angles

| Angle | Description | Prompt Phrase | Emotional Effect |
|-------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Eye level** | Neutral, 5ft height | "eye level shot" | Normal, documentary |
| **Low angle** | Camera looks up | "low angle shot, camera looking up" | Power, menace, grandeur |
| **High angle** | Camera looks down | "high angle shot, bird's eye view" | Vulnerability, overview |
| **Dutch angle** | Tilted horizon | "dutch angle, tilted frame" | Unease, disorientation |
| **Over-the-shoulder (OTS)** | Behind character | "over the shoulder shot" | Conversation, perspective |
| **POV** | Character's eyes | "first person point of view" | Immersion, identification |
| **God's eye** | Directly overhead | "top down view, aerial shot" | Omniscience, fate |

## Camera Movement (For Video Prompts)

Camera movement in AI video models is controlled via **prompt description**, not physical camera rigging. Different models handle this differently:

| Model | Camera Control Method | Reliability |
|-------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Wan 2.2 14B** | ✅ Prompt-only — best-in-class motion understanding | High — Wan reads camera language well |
| **Seedance 2.5** (current default) | Prompt only | High — plain-language camera moves work natively |
| **HunyuanVideo** | Prompt-only | Medium |

> **For our pipeline (Seedance 2.5):** Camera movement is handled by prompt language only. "Camera slowly pushes in" produces a dolly-in effect; plain-language camera moves work natively. No add-ons needed.

### Movement Reference Table

| Movement | Prompt phrase |
|----------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| **Dolly in** | "camera slowly pushes in toward the subject" | "camera slowly pushes in" | ✅ Via Dolly Out reversed |
| **Dolly out** | "camera slowly pulls back from the subject" | "camera slowly pulls back" | ✅ `Dolly-Out` |
| **Truck (track)** | "camera tracks left, following the character" | "camera tracks left to right" | ✅ `Dolly-Right` |
| **Pan** | "camera pans right, revealing the room" | "camera pans right" | ✅ `Pan-Right` |
| **Crane up** | "camera rises up smoothly" | "camera rises up" | ✅ `Jib-Up` |
| **Crane down** | "camera descends to eye level" | "camera descends" | ✅ `Jib-Down` |
| **Static** | "static camera, locked off" | "static camera, locked off" | ✅ `Static` |
| **Handheld** | "handheld camera, slight natural shake" | "handheld camera, slight shake" | — Use prompt only |
| **Steadicam** | "smooth floating steadicam shot" | "smooth floating camera movement" | — Use prompt only |

### Camera Prompting Tips

1. **Use full sentences, not tags** — "the camera slowly dollies in on the character's face as she realizes the truth" works better than "dolly in, closeup, reveal"
2. **Pair camera movement with subject action** — Don't just describe the camera; describe what the camera sees changing
3. **Motion arcs work across the full clip** — The camera move happens over the entire video duration, not between the first and last frame
4. **Weight matters** — Use "slowly" and "smoothly" for intentional-feeling camera moves; the model follows the adverb

### First → Last Frame Strategy

The first and last frame images should differ ONLY in the intended change. Background, lighting, character position (when not moving) must match:

```
WEAK: First frame = wide shot of room, Last frame = closeup of face
       → Morphing artifacts, disorienting

STRONG: First frame = character sitting at desk looking down
        Last frame = character sitting at desk looking up, surprised
         → Natural head movement, believable transition
```

### Tip: Describe the Motion Arc in the Prompt

Instead of just "dolly in," describe the full motion:

```
WEAK: "camera pushes in"
STRONG: "camera slowly dollies in on the character's face,
         background slightly blurring, soft focus effect,
         warm light intensifying as we move closer"
```

## Composition Rules for AI Prompts

| Rule | How to Encode in Prompt | Effect |
|------|------------------------|--------|
| **Rule of thirds** | "off-center composition, subject in left third" | Dynamic, professional |
| **Leading lines** | "leading lines drawing eye to subject, corridor perspective" | Depth, direction |
| **Framing** | "framed by doorway, vignette of shadows around edges" | Depth, focus |
| **Negative space** | "vast empty space on the right, subject small on left" | Isolation, scale |
| **Symmetry** | "perfectly symmetrical composition" | Grandeur, order |
| **Depth of field** | "shallow depth of field, background bokeh" | Focus on subject |
| **Shallow focus** | "only subject in focus, foreground and background blurry" | Intimacy |
| **Deep focus** | "everything in focus from foreground to background" | Clarity, documentary |

## Lens Characteristics

| Lens | Look | Prompt Phrase | Best For |
|------|------|---------------|----------|
| **35mm** | Standard, natural | "35mm lens" | Dialogue, natural scenes |
| **50mm** | "Nifty fifty", human eye | "50mm lens, standard focal length" | Portraits, intimacy |
| **85mm** | Compression, flattering | "85mm portrait lens" | Closeups, beauty shots |
| **24mm** | Wide, distorted edges | "24mm wide angle lens" | Landscapes, interiors |
| **14mm** | Ultra-wide, dramatic | "ultra wide angle lens, 14mm, dramatic perspective" | Establishing shots |
| **200mm** | Telephoto, compression | "200mm telephoto lens, compressed background" | Surveillance, isolation |
| **Anamorphic** | Cinematic flares, 2.35:1 | "anamorphic lens, blue lens flares" | Cinematic, sci-fi |
| **Fisheye** | Extreme distortion | "fisheye lens, curved distortion" | Unreality, POV |

## Lighting Design

### Lighting Styles

| Style | Prompt Description | Mood |
|-------|-------------------|------|
| **Three-point** | "key light from right, fill light left, rim light from behind" | Standard, professional |
| **Rembrandt** | "Rembrandt lighting, triangle of light on cheek, single key light" | Dramatic, classic |
| **Chiaroscuro** | "chiaroscuro lighting, deep shadows, strong contrast" | Noir, mystery |
| **High key** | "high key lighting, bright even illumination, minimal shadows" | Happy, commercial |
| **Low key** | "low key lighting, mostly shadows, single small light source" | Suspense, noir |
| **Silhouette** | "backlit silhouette, rim light, subject dark" | Mystery, drama |
| **Practical light** | "lit only by table lamp, warm 2700K, shadows reaching up" | Cozy, intimate |
| **Neon** | "neon lighting, magenta and cyan, pools of colored light" | Cyberpunk, stylized |
| **Golden hour** | "golden hour light, warm orange, long soft shadows" | Romantic, nostalgic |
| **Moonlight** | "moonlit scene, cool blue light, pale shadows" | Night, mystery |

### Color Temperature in Prompts

| Temperature | Kelvin | Prompt Words |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Warm | 2700-3500K | "warm amber light, candlelight, golden" |
| Neutral | 5000-5500K | "neutral white light, daylight balanced" |
| Cool | 6000-7500K | "cool blue light, moonlight, clinical white" |
| Mixed | Varies | "warm key light against cool background, color contrast" |

### AI Film Lighting Tips

1. **The image model handles dramatic lighting beautifully** — chiaroscuro, neon, and silhouette are where it shines. Flat "office lighting" produces the worst results.
2. **Describe the light SOURCE** — not just "dim" but "lit by a single bare bulb hanging from the ceiling, harsh shadows, spiderweb of cracks in the plaster"
3. **The video model struggles with flickering/changing lights** — if the light changes mid-clip, the result looks unnatural. Keep lighting consistent within a clip unless it's a dramatic reveal.
4. **"Cinematic lighting" is a real prompt phrase** that the image model understands. Use it as a quality booster.

## Color Palette (Film Look)

| Palette | Prompt Colors | Mood |
|---------|--------------|------|
| **Teal & Orange** | "teal shadows, orange skin tones, blockbuster color grade" | Hollywood, modern |
| **Desaturated** | "desaturated, muted colors, low saturation" | Bleak, realistic |
| **Warm / Amber** | "warm color grade, amber shadows" | Nostalgic |
| **Cool / Blue** | "cool blue color grade, cyan tint" | Sci-fi, clinical |
| **Technicolor** | "vibrant saturated colors, technicolor look" | Stylized, retro |
| **Monochrome** | "black and white, monochrome, high contrast" | Noir, timeless |
| **Split tone** | "split toning, teal shadows with peach highlights" | Stylized modern |
| **Sepia** | "sepia tone, vintage photograph look" | Period, memory |

### Color Grade System (Stacks on Film Stock)

The color grade is the final color treatment — it stacks on top of the film stock's base color science. Specify both for precise control:

| Grade | Prompt Phrase | Stacks On |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **Teal and orange** | "teal shadows, orange skin tones, blockbuster color grade" | ARRI Alexa |
| **High contrast crushed blacks** | "crushed blacks, deep shadows, high contrast" | Any stock |
| **Desaturated flat** | "desaturated, muted colors, flat matte finish" | Fujifilm |
| **Golden hour amber** | "warm amber grade, golden highlights" | Kodak Portra |
| **Vibrant saturated** | "vibrant colors, saturated, technicolor" | 35mm |
| **Cool blue and teal** | "cool blue color grade, teal highlights" | ARRI Alexa |
| **Flat matte lifted shadows** | "lifted blacks, flat matte finish, modern commercial" | Any stock |

## Film Stock / Camera Body (Visual DNA)

Each camera body carries a distinct color science and visual feel applied globally across the shoot. This is the **visual DNA** — get this right and everything downstream benefits.

| Camera Body | Look | Prompt Phrase | Best For |
|-------------|------|---------------|----------|
| **ARRI Alexa** | Cinematic, clean, neutral | "shot on ARRI Alexa, cinematic color science" | General cinema, blockbuster look |
| **Fujifilm** | Warm, faded, filmic | "Fujifilm stock, warm color profile, slightly faded" | Nostalgic, indie, romance |
| **Kodak Portra 400** | Editorial, natural skin tones | "Kodak Portra 400, editorial color" | Portraits, fashion, beauty |
| **16mm** | Grainy, raw, documentary | "16mm film stock, heavy grain, raw documentary feel" | Gritty realism, found footage |
| **35mm** | Classic grain, cinema | "35mm film stock, classic cinema grain" | Period pieces, classic cinema |
| **Hasselblad** | Tonal depth, medium format | "Hasselblad medium format, rich tonal gradation" | High-end editorial, luxury |
| **Disposable camera** | Flash, nostalgic, lo-fi | "disposable camera aesthetic, direct flash, slightly overexposed" | 90s nostalgia, candid moments |
| **GoPro** | Fisheye, action POV | "GoPro POV, wide fisheye, action camera" | Action sequences, POV shots |

**Film stock + color grade stacking example:** `Fujifilm (warm, faded) + High contrast crushed blacks` = warm-but-punchy indie look. `ARRI Alexa (clean) + Flat matte lifted shadows` = modern commercial aesthetic.

## Cut Types & Pacing (Video Editing)

For multi-shot sequences, specify cut types between shots to control energy and time:

| Cut | Prompt Phrase | Effect |
|-----|---------------|--------|
| **Smash cut** | "smash cut to" | Jarring, maximum contrast — best for tense reveals, flashbacks |
| **Hard cut** | "hard cut to" | Clean, standard — invisible editing |
| **Dissolve** | "dissolve to" | Time passing, soft transition — dreamlike, reflective |
| **Match cut** | "match cut, [visual element] carries through" | Visual rhyme — connects two scenes through a shared shape/motion |
| **Whip pan** | "whip pan to" | Energy, disorientation — action beat between shots |

### Pacing Styles

| Style | Clip Duration | Feel | Best For |
|-------|--------------|------|----------|
| **Fast cuts** | 2-3s per clip | Urgent, energetic | Action, trailers, TikTok |
| **Slow cinema** | 4-8s per clip | Deliberate, contemplative | Drama, emotional beats |
| **Mixed** | Varies (fast flashback / slow present) | Dynamic | Timeline splits, genre blends |

## Aspect Ratios

| Ratio | Name | Use | Frame Size |
|-------|------|-----|-----------|
| **16:9** | Widescreen | Standard video | 2048×1152 (the pipeline's default) |
| **2.35:1** | Cinemascope | Epic film look | 2400×1024 |
| **4:3** | Academy | Vintage, surveillance | 1536×1152 |
| **1:1** | Square | Social media | 1024×1024 |
| **9:16** | Vertical | TikTok/Reels/Shorts | 1152×2048 (vertical projects) |

> **Recommendation for micro-dramas:** 16:9 for YouTube, 9:16 for TikTok/Reels distribution.
> **Both edges of any custom size must be multiples of 16** (max edge 3840, aspect ratio up to
> 3:1, total pixels 655,360–8,294,400) — an invalid pair is snapped silently rather than
> rejected, so a request for 1920×1080 comes back 1920×1072 with no error. Use the sizes above,
> and treat only 16:9 and 9:16 as pipeline standards.

## Shot List Template (for Pipeline)

Each script scene is broken into **sub-scenes** (1A, 1B, 1C...) — one per camera position.
Each sub-scene becomes one shot card in the studio with one first-frame keyframe image.

```markdown
## SHOT LIST — [Scene Title]

| Sub | Shot | Size | Angle | Movement | Lens | Lighting | Duration | Keyframe (moment before action) |
|-----|------|------|-------|----------|------|----------|----------|-------------|
| 1A | WS | Wide | Eye level | Dolly in | 35mm | Golden hour | 5s | Character at the room's edge, before entering |
| 1B | MCU | Medium | Low angle | Static | 85mm | Rembrandt | 5s | Character looking down, before the look up |
| 1C | CU | Closeup | Eye level | Push in | 50mm | Chiaroscuro | 4s | Neutral expression, before the smile |
```

## Sub-Scene Shot Size Convention

| Letter | Shot Size | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **A** | Wide / Establishing | Location setting, scale |
| **B** | Medium / Two-shot / OTS | Dialogue, interaction |
| **C** | Closeup / ECU | Emotion, reaction, detail |

## Storyboard Grid Annotation Strips

A production-level storyboard grid (9-panel 3×3) needs annotation strips under each panel to communicate camera, action, and mood. These are written as screenplay-style slug lines — short, uppercase, period-separated.

### Three-Line Format

Each panel's annotation strip carries three short lines:

```
CAM:    [camera framing and movement]
MOVE:   [what the subject does — short, punchy]
MOOD:   [emotional / atmospheric beat]
```

### Genre-Adaptive Third Line

The third line adapts to what matters most for the genre:

| Line Tag | Genre | Carries |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **MOOD** | Default drama / dance / cinematic narrative | Atmosphere, emotion |
| **VOICE** | Vlog / influencer / dialogue-driven | The spoken line |
| **STYLE** | Martial arts / action / fight choreography | Stance or technique |

### Annotation Rhythm

Annotations must read like a director's notes, not a paragraph. Target cadence:

- **2-6 words per line**
- **End-of-line periods** to separate short phrases: `SLOW LOW ORBIT. WIDE.`
- **Uppercase** for production-note feel
- **No full sentences** — slug lines only

### Strong Examples

```
CAM: SLOW LOW ORBIT. WIDE.         CAM: WHIP-PAN WITH LUNGE. MEDIUM.
MOVE: STANDOFF. CHERRY PETALS.     MOVE: VIPER LUNGES, PALM STRIKE.
MOOD: TENSION. STILLNESS.          STYLE: VIPER — SILAT / VIPER'S BITE.

CAM: SELFIE CAM. CLOSE.            CAM: RISING ORBIT. PUSH-IN.
MOVE: HOLDS BOTTLE UP TO CAMERA.   MOVE: FULL-BODY EXTENSION. ARMS REACH.
VOICE: "OKAY GUYS, I FOUND IT."    MOOD: AWAKENING. SOFT PIANO. BUILD.
```

### Design Rule

Request the annotation text in a clean, high-contrast sans-serif font legible at the rendered grid size. The whole point of the strip is that the user can read it — bad legibility kills the board's usefulness as a production document.

## Scene Breakdown Format (Sub-Scene Naming)

For AI film production, each script scene should be broken into **sub-scenes** by shot size/angle. Each sub-scene gets one card, one first+last frame generation, and one video clip.

### Naming Convention
```
Scene 1A — The Archive (Wide)
Scene 1B — The Archive (Confrontation)
Scene 1C — The Archive (Reaction)
```

### Standard Breakdown Template

| Sub-Scene | Shot Size | Purpose | Duration |
|-----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **A** | Wide / Establishing | Set the scene, show location | 10-15s |
| **B** | Medium / Two-shot / OTS | Dialogue, interaction | 15-30s |
| **C** | Closeup / ECU | Reaction, emotional beat, reveal | 5-10s |

### Per Micro-Drama (5 script scenes × 3 shots each = 15 sub-scenes)

For a 10-minute film with 5 script scenes, the breakdown typically produces 10-15 sub-scenes:

| Script Scene | Sub-Scenes | Total Clips |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Scene 1 | 1A (Wide) + 1B (Medium) + 1C (CU) | 3 |
| Scene 2 | 2A (Wide) + 2B (CU) | 2 |
| Scene 3 | 3A (Wide) + 3B (Two-shot) + 3C (CU) | 3 |
| Scene 4 | 4A (Wide) + 4B (Medium) + 4C (CU) | 3 |
| Scene 5 | 5A (Wide) + 5B (CU) | 2 |
| **Total** | | **13** |

### First-Frame Strategy per Sub-Scene

Each sub-scene gets **one first-frame keyframe**: the opening composition at this shot size, captured the moment BEFORE the action. The video model moves forward from it — the motion and camera move go in the video prompt, not the image.

The camera direction should describe the **progression within the shot**, e.g.:
- "Wide → medium push" means the camera stays wide at start and pushes in by end
- "Closeup" means the camera stays tight throughout
- "Pull back" means starting tight and ending wider

### Why This Format Works for AI

1. **The video model generates 4-second-minimum clips on the premium lane, 5-second-minimum on the budget lane (plan 4–6s on Seedance 2.5; the budget lane's MiniMax H3 floor is 5s, so a 3s or 4s shot cannot be made there)** — each sub-scene maps to one generation
2. **Consistent framing within a clip** — easier for the model than a scene that mixes wide and closeup
3. **Clear approval workflow** — approve/reject individual shots without redoing the whole scene
4. **Each card gets 2 attachments** (first + last frame) and produces 1 video — clean mapping

## Visual Style Archetypes

For establishing the **overall visual language of an entire project** (not just individual shots), these archetypes package color grade, lighting, camera movement, and architectural vocabulary into a single consistent system. Pick one archetype at the concept stage — it becomes the visual DNA every prompt inherits.

### How to Use These Archetypes

1. **Pick one at concept stage** — The entire project inherits the archetype's visual DNA.
2. **Reference the archetype name in every scene prompt** — e.g., `Clinical corporate dystopia aesthetic: [scene description]`
3. **Mix archetypes for specific beats** — A story set in Clinical Corporate Dystopia can cut to Suburban Paranormal for a flashback. Just be deliberate and consistent about which archetype governs which timeline.
4. **Archetype stacks on film stock and color grade** — The archetype establishes the overall visual language; film stock and color grade refine the execution. `Clinical corporate dystopia + ARRI Alexa + cool blue grade` is a valid stack.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Asking the image model for shots it can't do** — Wide shots with multiple characters often have garbled anatomy. If you need a wide shot, describe it abstractly or use silhouette. Save closeups for &quot;hero&quot; images.
2. **The video model can't do rapid camera moves** — a whip pan or crash zoom will look like a glitch. Stick to slow dollying, trucking, or subtle pushes.
3. **Mixing lighting in one clip** — If the keyframe is &quot;golden hour&quot; but the prompt asks for a &quot;moonlit&quot; shift mid-clip, the model produces weird semi-lit frames. Keep lighting consistent within a clip.
4. **Aspect ratio consistency** — Keep your keyframes 16:9 from the start; the clip inherits the keyframe's aspect ratio, so a mixed set of ratios breaks the edit.
5. **Too much camera movement for short clips** — In a 5-second clip, a &quot;dolly in from wide to closeup&quot; is too much distance. Use subtle movement for short clips.
